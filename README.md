# Global-Economy-Playground
This repository documents my journey of learning finance and economics through data. Note that I barely know anything about finance and economy.
Coming from a computer science background, I’m using this project to connect my skills in Python, visualization, and machine learning with real-world economic indicators.
Using the [Global Economy Indicators (1970–2021)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/global-economy-indicators)
- Learn about Finance & Economy
- Build visualizations using the knowledge i've learned.
- Experiment with machine learning and its applications in this topic.
